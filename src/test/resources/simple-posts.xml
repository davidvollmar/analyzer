&lt;p&gt;There is a common type of Arabic called &quot;classical Arabic&quot; (fusha) which stretches back at least 1000 years back. It's still used today for most media (eg. newspapers, textbooks) and in universities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, each country has its own dialect (or slang) version of Arabic. This includes both use of vocabulary, and also actual grammar (or ignoring the classical grammar).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some of the sample questions on Area 51 talk about Arabic in a specific area, the question is really how we should plan and organize questions, or whether we should focus exclusively on classical Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="2" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2015-07-14T18:42:42.553" Score="0" Body="&lt;p&gt;While allowing non-classical Arabic questions will give us more questions being asked, I think it will hurt the site because of two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readability:&lt;/strong&gt; If users can ask questions in Arabic, you now need a bigger user base that covers whatever country-specific version the question is in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answerability:&lt;/strong&gt; Like above, if we don't have site users who know that specific version of Arabic (and in sufficient depth and detail to give a strong answer), we'll end up with a bunch of open, unanswerable questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we can let this play out (allowing country-specific Arabic questions) and see what happens. As a start, we should at least try to &lt;em&gt;tag country-specific Arabic questions appropriately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="3" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2015-07-14T19:16:18.303" Score="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;For both of the main potential audiences of this site, I think we should include the regional dialects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For native speakers, the regional dialects form a large portion of Arabic as it's spoken today.  For learners, learning at least one dialect is often considered a necessary part of learning the Arabic language (and is pretty important if you actually want to visit a country).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does mean we should be careful with tagging questions, and it also means we should be open to questions having multiple answers corresponding to different regions.  But the StackExchange format is well-suited to that, and other sites handle the same issue fine.  (For instance, on Academia, many questions have multiple answers with begin by explaining which fields the answer is relevant to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final point: fusha refers to both Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic.  These languages are pretty similar, but there are some usage differences.  So whether or not we include the regional dialects, we should keep in mind that some questions may have multiple answers depending on the language variant (and tag accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;

  <row Id="4" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1" CreationDate="2015-07-14T20:05:50.737" Score="-3" Body="&lt;p&gt;Arabic was never a single language, even before Islam and even when Islam came. That's why Quran was sent to Mohammed in 7 different tongues (dialects), not be confused with Qira'at (القراءات). The common dialect at that time was لغة قريش. It is called Arabic mainly because of the race, not because of the language itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, same thing is applicable now, the classical Arabic we see now is mainly from Quran and Current Quran is mainly from the Quraish version (one of the seven dialects). In addition to that, each country/region/tribe of Arabs has its own dialect/accent, nothing new here as this was the case throughout history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, this site should be about all Arabic Language variants (classic or dialects) especially that almost all Arabs are capable of understanding each other mutually with no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
